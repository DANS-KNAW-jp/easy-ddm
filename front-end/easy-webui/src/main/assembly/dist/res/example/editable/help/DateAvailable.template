<strong>Date available</strong>
<p>You can use this option to impose a temporary restriction, e.g. because of a thesis/publication that is about to be completed. The default <em>date available</em> is today, implying no temporary restriction. To impose a temporary restriction, change the date into a date in the future. Until that date specified by you, there is an <em>embargo</em> period, in which the data files will not be accessible by any user. After that date, your dataset becomes automatically available for registered EASY users, under the conditions you specified as <em>Access rights</em>. The embargo period (time between today and the date specified) cannot be longer than two years and cannot be extended.<br /><br /><strong>NB:</strong> data files which are not yet available will still be visible to other users.&#160;
