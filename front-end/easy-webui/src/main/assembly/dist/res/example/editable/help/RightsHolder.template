<p><strong>Rights holder<br /></strong><br />Owner of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights.<br /><br />In publications, clear reference is always made to the individual or organization that is holder of the copyright. In principle, the right to publish and reproduce a publication, scientific or otherwise, is vested in the author(s) or organization where the author(s) are employed. This copyright may, however, have been transferred to a commercial or non-commercial publisher.<br /><br />Insofar as datasets are concerned, the copyright is usually vested in the creator(s). In most cases, the field &#8216;Creator' is used to fill in the name of the researcher, and the field &#8216;(Copy)right holder' is used to fill in the name of the organization where he/she is employed.<br /><br /><strong>NB:</strong> If you do not fill in the holder of the copyrights or intellectual property rights here, the right will be assigned automatically to the individual or organization referred to &#8216;Creator'. If the publication or the dataset has been reused, the creator(s) must be granted the scientific credits for his/her/their work in the form of clear source references.<br /><br />Click the [+] button behind a field to add an additional field.<br /><br /><strong>Examples<br /></strong><br />Auxilia, Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen<br />Amsterdam University Press, Amsterdam</p>
