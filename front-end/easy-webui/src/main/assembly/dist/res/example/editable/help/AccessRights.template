<p>Description of the accessibility to the dataset.</p>
<p>The datasets may be made accessible to users and/or re-users in various ways. The following options are available for making the datasets accessible:</p>
<p>&#8226;	Open access<br />The files are accessible to all registered users of EASY.<br />&#8226;	Restricted access<br />The access to the files deposited is limited to a smaller group of users. EASY currently has the two following forms of limited access:<br />-Restricted - archaeology group. Please note that this option can only be selected for archaeological deposits.<br />The datasets are only accessible to registered users of EASY who belong to a specific group. In principle, this option is used as default for all archaeological datasets. Just like Archis is an information system for and by archaeologists, the archaeological files in EASY are also only accessible to other, registered archaeologists. We share the available information on archaeological sites, without this information being immediately available on the Internet so that we can preserve the historical buildings and/or archaeological sites or perform scientific research as effectively as possible.<br />-Restricted - request permission.<br />With this option, you - as the person depositing the dataset - can personally manage the accessibility to the files deposited by you. The datasets are accessible only if another registered user, not necessarily an archaeologist, has submitted a &#8216;permission request'. You, the person depositing the dataset, will be informed of this request and you will personally be able to grant or reject this request for permission to access the dataset.<br />&#8226;	Other access<br /> It is not possible to access the datasets through EASY. DANS is only intended for sustainable, digital archiving behind the scenes. Another possibility is that the data have been stored elsewhere and that only the metadata have been stored in EASY. You can only choose this option if the digital data are accessible, for example, through a different data repository, digital archive, databank or website.</p>
<p>Please consult the DANS Data Guide for more information on access rights, access restrictions, and copyrights. <br /><br /><strong>NB:</strong> The descriptive information on the research project and the dataset (metadata) is always freely accessible to all users of the Internet. This provides each potential user or re-user the opportunity to find the files and to assess whether they are valuable to his/her research. In order to actually being able to download the data, users must first create an account.</p>
