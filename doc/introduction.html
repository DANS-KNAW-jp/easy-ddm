<p>When using a SAX parser you have to assign a content handler to a
	reader. Such a handler receives notifications of document events such
	as start-element and end-element.</p>
<p>Our handler map knows which handlers to use for which elements.
	The handler map makes its decisions based on the parameters received at
	the start of an element.</p>
<p>Leafs in the family of handler classes know in which element of
	the target object (type parameter T, Handler.getTarget method) to put
	the received data. The generic handler uses the handler map to switch
	control between handlers. When giving control to another handler, the
	target object, handler map and other administration are passed on. To
	make sure subclasses of the generic handler canâ€™t disturb control
	switching, the methods startElement and endElement are declared final.
	These event notifications are handed down to subclasses with other
	method names: initElement/initFirstElement and finishElement. The
	method initFirstElement gives handlers of complex elements a chance to
	cleanup from a previous cycle, for example by creating an empty sub
	target.</p>
<p>The handler map uses the default constructor of the handlers. The
	other (package-private) constructor of the generic handler assigns
	itself to the reader of the SAX parser. AbstractCrosswalk.parse uses
	the latter constructor to start the crosswalk. But first it validates
	the XML document against the XSD (type parameter V) to reduce the
	validations required by the handlers.</p>
<p>Currently neither the handler map nor the handlers have any
	knowledge about the path in the XML tree.</p>
