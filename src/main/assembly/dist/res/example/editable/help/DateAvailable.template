<b>Date available</b>
  <p>You can use this option to impose a temporary restriction, e.g. because
  of a thesis/publication that is about to be completed. The default <i>date
  available</i> is today, implying no temporary restriction. To impose a
  temporary restriction, change the date into a date in the future. Until
  that date specified by you, there is an <i>embargo</i> period, in which
  the data files will not be accessible by any user. After that date, your
  dataset becomes automatically available for registered EASY users, under
  the conditions you specified as <i>Access rights</i>. The embargo period
  (time between today and the date specified) cannot be longer than two
  years and cannot be extended. </p>
