<h2>Upload dataset</h2>
<p>Uploading files in EASY.<br /><br />By means of the field &#8216;File upload', you can actually link the data files to the metadata you have just filled in. This field gives you the possibility to search the files of the dataset and the relevant documentation on your PC and to upload them. If it concerns a limited number of files, you can upload the files one by one. If the datasets are larger or more complex, it is recommended to make a zip file of all directories and to subsequently upload this file as if it is only one file. Depending on your zip application, choose &#8216;Include subfolder' and &#8216;Save path information'. While uploading, the zip file will be unpacked again in its original directory structure.<br /><br />If desired, you can check what files have been uploaded by means of the &#8216;Show files' button.<br /><br /><strong>NB</strong>: If the dataset is very large, it is recommended to send the files to DANS by means of a different medium, such as a CD, a DVD or an external hard drive. This is also recommended if the dataset in zip file is larger than 100 MB or if it contains more than 1,000 files.<br />If you send the files without using EASY, it is still possible to finish the project description in EASY: just click &#8216;submit' on the last page without uploading any files. You can indicate in the field &#8216;Remarks' on the third tab that the files will be forwarded. <br /><br />Whether a dataset is used often or rarely depends largely on the presence of qualitatively good documentation on the data. <br />If this documentation is lacking, it will be difficult for another researcher to understand, let alone use your data. <br /> In addition to the metadata referred to above, the documentation files form an integral part of the data deposit. In most cases, the documentation files include the following documents:</p>
<p>&#8226;	A documented list of files with a description of the contents and technical details of each separate file deposited;<br />&#8226;	Code book(s), with an explanation of the data structure, names of variables and layers, abbreviations and codes used.</p>
<p>It is recommended to put the metadata documents in a separate subdirectory within the zip file.<br />Please consult the DANS Data Guide for a complete list of relevant documentation and a detailed explanation of the importance of adequate metadata.</p>
