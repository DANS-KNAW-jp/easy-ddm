Classes involved in the java representation of easymetadata.
<p>
EasyMetadata is the main class in this package.
It contains 0 or more EmdContainers which in turn contain terms.
A container groups terms of a certain category. A term is a list of items. The name of both container and term is equal to the name
of one of the terms defined by <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms">Dublin Core Terms</a>, or it is not. When it is not,
there are reasons to deviate from this standard, either because the standard does not have a term for this category of meta data, or the
category we want to impose has a too global meaning. As a consequence, containers and terms that deviate from the naming in the above
mentioned standard cannot be expressed in terms of said standard.
</p>
<p>
A EmdContainer groups meta data of a certain category.
It contains the term of the same name, as well as terms that qualify it (DCMI-terms or Qualified Dublin Core).
Besides these it can contain lists of items pertaining to the same category but with a more complex structure.
</p>
<p>
Terms that deviate from the naming in the above mentioned standard should be grouped in the container
EmdOther.
