Defines the IStore interface.
Typical usage:
<pre>
        ...
    (1) StoreSession session = storeManager.newStoreSession("ownerId");
        try 
        {
            MyDataModelObject myDmo = (MyDataModelObject) session.getDataModelObject(myDmoStoreId);
            // ...
    (2)     // do things with myDmo and its associated classes
            // ...
    (3)     session.commit();
        }
        finally
        {
    (4)     session.close();
        }
        ...
</pre>
<ol>
<li>An instance of StoreSession is obtained from an implementation of StoreManager.</li>
<li>DataModelObjects are deserializations of xml. Associations to other DataModelObjects are not concrete.
However, during the time a DataModelObject is attached to a StoreSession, you can traverse the
object graph of associated DataModelObjects, and let them interact.</li>
<li>After the interaction, all affected DataModelObjects are committed to the repository.</li>
<li>In a final clause, the temporary association with the session is released. Associations from
one DataModelObject to another that were realized during the session, remain intact.</li>
</ol>
