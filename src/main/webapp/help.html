      <a name="Rights"></a><b>Access Rights</b>
      <p>(Required)</p>
      <p>
      </p><p>DANS advocates the <i>Open access</i> guidelines of the OECD. This
      means that DANS promotes the free availability of research data and
      publications (option <i>Open access</i> below). However, there may be
      justified reasons for not making research data freely available. This may
      be because they contain personal data. There may also be contractual
      obligations with third parties. <br>DANS therefore allows data to be made
      available under additional access conditions, described below. You can
      combine these with a temporary restriction on your research data, using
      the <i>Date available</i> field. <br></p>
      <p><b>Option: Open access</b> <br>Select this category if you wish to
      grant <i>Open access</i> on your research data. This means that any
      registered user has immediate and unrestricted access to your dataset via
      EASY. It is important to note here that you will always be able to track
      down by whom your research data were downloaded. Each time a dataset is
      downloaded from EASY, the user's details are recorded. This information is
      available to you and other registered users, via the <i>Activity logs</i>
      in EASY. <br></p>
      <p><b>Option: Restricted: request permission </b><br>Select this category
      if you wish to restrict the access to your data. Your dataset will be made
      available only to persons and/or organizations after your permission. You
      will receive an e-mail from DANS with the name of the person who wishes to
      access your data. You can then grant or deny access. <br>Please use this
      option only when strictly necessary. You may consider using a temporary
      restriction (see <i>Date available</i> field) combined with option <i>Open
      access</i>. <br></p>
      <p><b>Option: Other access </b><br>This is a special access category. It
      is only for datasets that will not be made available via EASY. Please
      select this category if your datasets are made available elsewhere (e.g.
      by you personally), but you still wish to archive them with DANS in order
      to preserve them for the long term. This also applies to datasets that
      contain personal data as referred to in the Personal Data Protection Act
      (Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens). A dataset contains personal data if
      the data themselves relate to specific living persons, but also if the
      dataset contains information that, in combination with other datasets for
      example, could be used to identify specific living persons. If you wish to
      use this access category, please consult DANS first in all cases via: <a href="http://www.dans.knaw.nl/en/data/help_en_support/" target="_blank">Help
      / Support</a> . A specific license agreement will have to be negotiated in
      this case. </p>
      <p><b>More information</b> <br>More about access rights <i>Open access</i>
      and <i>Restricted: request permission</i> can be found in the <a href="http://www.dans.knaw.nl/en/data_deponeren/licence_agreement_dans/lauk/" target="_blank">License Agreement </a><br></p>
      <hr>
      <a name="DateAvailable"></a><b>Date available</b>
      <p>You can use this option to impose a temporary restriction, e.g. because
      of a thesis/publication that is about to be completed. The default <i>date
      available</i> is today, implying no temporary restriction. To impose a
      temporary restriction, change the date into a date in the future. Until
      that date specified by you, there is an <i>embargo</i> period, in which
      the data files will not be accessible by any user. After that date, your
      dataset becomes automatically available for registered EASY users, under
      the conditions you specified as <i>Access rights</i>. The embargo period
      (time between today and the date specified) cannot be longer than two
      years and cannot be extended. </p>
      <hr>
      <a name="Upload"></a><b>Upload dataset</b>
      <p>Upload the dataset files and associated documentation. </p>
      <p>Files can be uploaded individually or as one or more zip files. Zip
      files have the advantage of reducing upload time and preserving the
      arrangement (directory structure) of the dataset. </p>
      <p><b>Size of the dataset.</b> Uploading datasets that exceed 100 MB can
      take quite some time. We recommend dividing large datasets into multiple
      zip files. For extremely large datasets, please contact DANS concerning
      other ways to submit the datasets: <a href="mailto:info@dans.knaw.nl">info@dans.knaw.nl</a> </p>
      <p><b>Documentation.</b> The options for using a data file are largely
      determined by the available documentation. DANS therefore requests that
      you submit all documentation that is relevant for re-using the dataset. In
      most cases, the documentation consists of the following documents:
      </p><ul>
        <li>a copy of the questionnaire or measuring instrument
        </li><li>a description of the sources (including archival sources) and
        selection procedures that were used
        </li><li>a description of the variables or a codebook
        </li><li>a copy of the research report containing a description of the
        data-collection procedure
        </li><li>description of any recoding or construction of variables
        </li><li>description of the data-cleaning procedure </li></ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>For a complete overview of relevant documentation and further
      instructions, please refer to Instructions (by discipline) on the first
      screen in the "Deposit" section. </p>

      <p>(Required, Repeatable)</p>
      <p>This dataset is relevant for researchers from the following
