Classes and interfaces concerned with security.

<h3>SecurityOfficers</h3>
Security is enforced by SecurityOfficers. Each SecurityOfficer holds a proposition that
it can evaluate against a given context. 
<p/>
A xxCheck SecurityOfficer evaluates a certain aspect of the context against it's (basic) proposition or sentence.
Logical SecurityOfficers (And, Or, Not) can be used to compose more complex propositions.
The SplitAnswer SecurityOfficer is used to differentiate propositions for visibility and enabling.
<p/>
A SecurityOfficer for a given item (component or action) can be obtained from (a class implementing) Authz
with the method Authz.getSecurityOfficer(String).
<p/>
The implication(s) of a proposition held by a SecurityOfficer can be seen as a <i>rule</i>.

<h3>Context</h3>
The context to be evaluated by a SecurityOfficer or a combination of SecurityOfficers can be
expressed in a generalized form using ContextParameters.
